# unit-4-game

Some simple pesudocoding:

* First step will be to display the page - show the title, directions, 4 crystals, a seperate divs/sections for the goal number, wins, and losses.
* The computer will choose a random number between 19 and 120 - this will be the goal number
* The com[uter will give a each of the four cystals a number between 1 and 12
* When you click on a crystal, that number will add up.
* if the number reaches the goal number, an alert will popup saying that you win the game. A win will be added to the total
* If the number reaches anything above the goal number, an alert will say that you loss the game, and a win will be added to the total
